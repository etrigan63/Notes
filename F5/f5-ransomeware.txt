risk management in infosec

Lab covers SSL visibiity

download EICAR file securely and then decrypt it in flight

Vectors - social engineering and phising (and whaling)
* Much easier to hack humans
* Email attachments and phishing links
* Training has to be ongoing to be effective

Vectors - Identity attacks
* Stolen, compromised or weak passwords
* Multi-factor authentication helps
* Actors use bots to automate the process
* Password spraying
  * What are the most common passwords used
  * Using harvested e-mail addresses and the common passwords and using a randomized login attempts to prevent brute-force lockouts.
* Credential Stuffing
  * Credential re-use
* RDP is commonly overlooked
  * MFA is critical for RDP exposed to Internet

Vectors - Web App Vulnerabilities
* 'Sodinokibi' ransomware exploited critical Oracle WebLogic flaw.
* Often overlooked
* Considered too complicated
* Overestimation of IDS/IPS or NGFW capabilities
* Defense in Depth and Zero Trust practices are not applied.
* Gain access, execute malware, then move laterally.

What Actors are not telling you
* No guarantee ransom payment will get data back
* They reserve the right to attack again
* Regardless of payment, data will be ex-filtrated

Motives
* Financial
  * Primary reason
* Political
  * State actor involvement
* Competetive
  * Denial of Service is a common side-effective

Ransomware Supply Chain
* Attackers used to write their own ransomware
  * ransomware for sale
  * ransomware as a Service
  * ransomware affiliate programs

Positive News
* DHS Cyber Hunt and Incident Team Actors
  * DHS will allocate resource to help

The 'Ryuk' ransomware has brought the issue to public eye.
* Refers to a character from the 'Death Note' manga.
* Artisanal ransomware, not mass-market
* Cleans up its install files making it hard to figure out Vectors
* Establishes persistence in the Windows Registry
* Deletes backups and volume shadow copies

Preventative Best Practices

Detective Recommended Practices
* Executive Sponsorship
* Defense in Depth
* Zero Trust
* SSL/TLS Visibility
* Multiple points of malware scanning with different vendors
* IDS/IPS
* Modern WAF - Start with basic policies
* GPO software restriction policies
* Review logs and investigate alerts

Containment Recommended Practices
* Executive Sponsorship
* Defense in Depth
* Zero Trust
* Assume compromise
* Strong authorization policies
* Least privilege
* User Behavior Analytics
* Network segmentation (East/West Firewlls)
* Review logs and investigate alerts

Corrective Recommended Practices
* Executive Sponsorship
* Have an incident response playbook and TEST IT.
* Consider engaging law enforcement and professional assistance
* Have an inventory, documentation and diagrams of systems
* have logging in place so you can review the data for forensic analysis
* have tested strategies for disaster recovery
  * 3-2-1 strategy
* Consider attempting identification and decryption with REPUTABLE free tools
